    /// What it costs to get a frame off the spacecraft: how many bits it is, how long the link
    /// takes to move them, and how much charge the exposure and the transmission consume.

    /// WHY THIS EXISTS AS PHYSICS RATHER THAN AS A CHECKBOX. The requirement is that a telescope
    /// in orbit can be operated from the ground only if it has power and a working antenna, and
    /// otherwise only from the spacecraft itself. That could have been a boolean. It is not one
    /// here, because the interesting version of the constraint is quantitative: a WFC3/UVIS
    /// full frame is 16.8 million pixels at 16 bits, which is 269 megabits, and the antenna
    /// carried decides whether that is a few seconds or most of an orbit. A small relay antenna
    /// on a large-format detector is a real design mistake a player can make, and it should cost
    /// them time rather than be silently allowed.
    ///
    /// WHAT IS AND IS NOT SOURCED. The frame size is arithmetic on the detector's own published
    /// format and ADC depth, so it is exact. The link rate is KSP's, taken from the antenna
    /// parts the player actually flew, because that is the hardware in the game; the real HST
    /// downlinks through TDRSS on a schedule set by a network shared with other spacecraft (HST
    /// Primer: Data Storage and Transmission), which has no counterpart in KSP and is not
    /// modelled. Electric charge is a game resource with no conversion to watts anywhere in KSP,
    /// so the power numbers are game balance and are labelled as such where they are declared
    /// (SpacePlatformSpec).
