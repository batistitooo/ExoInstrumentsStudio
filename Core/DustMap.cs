    /// WHAT IT IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT FOR. This is the TOTAL column, so it applies to something
    /// beyond all the dust, an external galaxy, or a quasar. It does NOT apply to a catalogue
    /// star: a star sits inside the Galaxy with an unknown fraction of the column in front of it,
    /// and Gaia's gspphot already publishes a per-source estimate that needs no distance of ours
    /// (see RenderedStar.ReddeningEBv). Using this for a star would over-redden every foreground
    /// one, by up to the whole column.
    ///
    /// Its other job is simply to be reported. Extinction toward the field is a number a real
    /// observer records with a frame, and the FITS header carries it.
    ///
    /// FORMAT. HEALPix, Galactic coordinates, one IEEE 754 half float per pixel. Half rather than
    /// a scaled integer because SFD98 spans 0.00037 to 135 magnitudes and no fixed-point scale
    /// covers both ends; see Float16. At the map's own 6.1 arcmin resolution the whole sky is
    /// nside 1024 and 24 MB, so it loads whole and needs no block index. tools/pack_dust_map.py writes it.
    ///
    /// NOTHING SHIPS, for the same reason the star catalogue ships nothing: the map is a published
    /// dataset with its own licence and its own download. With no file installed every query
    /// returns NaN and every caller treats that as "not known" rather than as zero.
