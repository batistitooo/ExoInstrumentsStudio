    /// WHY A FIT AND NOT AN ASSIGNMENT. A frame taken through a red filter is not the red primary of
    /// a display. It is the source's spectrum integrated against that filter times the optics times
    /// the detector's quantum efficiency times the atmosphere, a completely different weighting
    /// function from the CIE x-bar. Feeding the three band counts straight into R, G and B, which is
    /// what this replaces, produces an image whose colours depend on the filter set rather than on
    /// the sky: the same star comes out a different colour on two instruments.
    ///
    /// The correct operation is the one every camera does. Colour is three numbers, so a set of three
    /// bands determines it up to a 3x3 matrix, and that matrix is found by requiring it to reproduce
    /// the tristimulus values of a TRAINING SET of spectra passed through the same bands:
    ///
    ///     minimise  sum over spectra of | M . f(spectrum) - XYZ(spectrum) |^2
    ///
    /// where f is the vector of band responses. This is the same construction as a raw converter's
    /// colour matrix, and like one it has a residual, because three numbers cannot describe every
    /// spectrum; two different spectra with the same band counts are metamers and must come out the
    /// same colour. That residual is measured and reported rather than hidden.
    ///
    /// THE TRAINING SET is what the instrument is pointed at: blackbodies across the stellar
    /// temperature range, which is every star and every reflecting body, and the nebular line
    /// spectrum, which is every H II region. Both are weighted, because a matrix fitted on
