    /// A star's spectral shape when its catalogue colour is a REDDENED colour.

    /// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. StellarPhotometry.CollectedElectrons turns a catalogue B-V into an
    /// effective temperature (Ballesteros 2012) and integrates a blackbody at that temperature
    /// across the passband. The catalogue colour is the OBSERVED one; Gaia measures reddened
    /// photometry and GaiaPhotometry converts it without dereddening anything; so a hot star
    /// behind two magnitudes of dust is modelled as an intrinsically cool star. Those two have the
    /// same B-V by construction and genuinely different spectra: one is a smooth Planck curve
    /// peaking in the red, the other is a steeply blue Planck curve with the dust curve carved out
    /// of it. Across a wide band they integrate to different effective widths, so the electron
    /// count is wrong by whatever that difference is.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS IS NOT DOUBLE COUNTING. The bandpass integrand is normalised at Johnson V, so what
    /// it uses is a SHAPE and the observed V magnitude sets the scale. Multiplying the shape by
    ///
    ///     10^(-0.4 A(lambda)) / 10^(-0.4 A(V))
    ///
    /// leaves it exactly 1 at V by construction. The star's observed brightness is untouched;
    /// only the distribution of that brightness across the band changes. Nothing is attenuated
    /// twice, because nothing is attenuated at all; the observed magnitude already contains the
    /// dimming, and this only stops the reddening from being mistaken for a cool photosphere.
    ///
    /// WHAT IT NEEDS. The intrinsic colour, (B-V)_0 = (B-V) - E(B-V), which needs E(B-V) for that
    /// star. Gaia DR3's own astrophysical-parameters pipeline publishes one per source, which is
    /// where RenderedStar.ReddeningEBv comes from; a sight-line dust map is the fallback for a
    /// catalogue that carries none. With no estimate at all this class is not used and the
    /// photometry is exactly what it was, which is the honest behaviour rather than a guess.
