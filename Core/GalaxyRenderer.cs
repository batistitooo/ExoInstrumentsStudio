    /// central slope; for n = 4 the surface brightness rises as R^(-3/4) all the way in, so the
    /// value at a pixel's centre is not its average over the pixel, and point sampling a galaxy's

    /// with the subdivision level set by how much the profile varies across the pixel rather than
    /// by a fixed rule. Far out the profile is flat on a pixel scale and one sample is exact to
    /// better than the frame's own noise.
