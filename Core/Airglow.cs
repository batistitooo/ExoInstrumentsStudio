    /// ESO's model puts 11148 rayleighs into those lines between 350 and 1000 nm against 5290 in the
    /// residual continuum; so most of the dark sky is LINES, and a narrowband filter either sits on

    /// [O I] from the ground; an H-alpha filter at 656.3 sits in a relatively clear window between OH
