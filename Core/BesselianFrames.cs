    /// WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A PRECESSION. B1875 is a BESSELIAN equinox of the old fundamental
    /// system (FK4), and J2000 is a JULIAN equinox of the new one (FK5). The two differ by more
    /// than the 125 years between them: the FK4 system carries a systematic rotation and a
    /// different precession constant, and running a modern precession model back to "the year
    /// 1875" silently conflates the two. The rigorous route, and the one astropy's FK4NoETerms
    /// frame takes, is in two steps:
    ///
    ///   1. FK5 J2000 -&gt; FK4 B1950, by the rotation matrix of Murray (1989, A&amp;A 218, 325,
    ///      eq. 28), which is the measured relationship between the two fundamental systems;
    ///   2. FK4 B1950 -&gt; FK4 B1875, by Newcomb's precession, the precession the FK4 system is
    ///      built on (expressions as tabulated in the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
    ///      Almanac, 1992, chapter 3).
    ///
    /// WHY NO E-TERMS. FK4 positions of stars carry the E-terms of elliptic aberration, up to
    /// 0.343 arcsec. Those are a property of an OBSERVED position, not of the coordinate grid;
    /// Delporte's boundaries are lines of constant right ascension and declination on that grid,
    /// so the E-terms do not belong in this chain. Roman's table quantises right ascension to
    /// 0.0001 h, which is 1.5 arcsec at the equator, so they would sit below its own resolution
    /// in any case.
    ///
    /// HOW ACCURATE THIS HAS TO BE. Only positions within a few arcseconds of a boundary can be
    /// affected at all, and the answer for those is genuinely ambiguous at the level of the
