    /// span. SFD98's reddening runs from 0.00037 magnitudes at the Galactic poles to 135 in the
    /// inner plane, a ratio of 3.6e5, against the 6.5e4 levels a 16-bit fixed-point value offers:
    /// any scale fine enough for the poles saturates in the plane, and any scale coarse enough for
    /// the plane quantises the poles to nothing. Choosing one silently discards the other, and the
    /// first version of the packer did exactly that; it marked 48615 pixels "no value", all of
    /// them at |b| below a degree.
    ///
    /// A half float has 11 bits of mantissa, so its precision is RELATIVE: 4.9e-4 of the value
    /// everywhere. That is 3e-5 magnitudes at the median sight line and 0.07 at the worst one in
    /// the sky, both far below SFD's own 16% calibration uncertainty, in the same two bytes.
