    /// How interstellar dust dims and reddens everything behind it.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS AtmosphericImagingNoise. Both attenuate, both are
    /// wavelength-dependent, and both belong inside the bandpass integral rather than at a central
    /// wavelength. They differ in the one way that matters to the architecture: the atmosphere is
    /// the SAME for every source in a frame (one airmass, one site), while dust is DIFFERENT for
    /// every source (each star sits at its own distance in its own direction, behind its own
    /// column). Atmospheric extinction can therefore be baked into SystemResponse's tabulation
    /// once per capture; interstellar extinction cannot, and needs a second axis on that table.
    ///
    /// WHAT IS PARAMETERISED AND WHAT IS NOT. An extinction curve is conventionally split into an
    /// AMOUNT and a SHAPE:
    ///
    ///     A(lambda) = A(V) * k(lambda),      A(V) = R_V * E(B-V)
    ///
    /// with k(lambda) = A(lambda)/A(V) the dimensionless shape, equal to 1 at V by construction.
    /// The amount, E(B-V), comes from a dust map and is a property of the line of sight. The shape
    /// is a property of the dust grains, parameterised by R_V = A(V)/E(B-V), the ratio of total to
    /// selective extinction: 3.1 is the Milky Way diffuse-ISM average (Fitzpatrick 1999 and
    /// essentially every survey since), rising toward 5 in dense clouds where grain growth has
    /// removed the small particles.
    ///
    /// TWO LAWS, DELIBERATELY.
    ///
    ///   * CCM89 (Cardelli, Clayton and Mathis 1989, ApJ 345, 245) is a closed-form polynomial in
    ///     x = 1/lambda. It can be implemented exactly, in a few lines, with nothing to interpolate
    ///     and no table to ship. It is also the single most-cited extinction law in astronomy.
    ///   * F99 (Fitzpatrick 1999, PASP 111, 63) is better in the optical, which is where every
    ///     instrument in this roster works: CCM89's optical polynomial carries systematic residuals
    ///     of a few hundredths of a magnitude that F99's spline does not. It is not closed-form;
    ///     it is a cubic spline through published anchor points, so it is carried as a TABLE,
    ///     generated from the published law and checked against the reference implementation.
    ///
    /// F99 is the default. CCM89 is kept because it is exactly implementable, which makes it the
    /// control: tools/dust-crossvalidation checks it against the reference implementation to 1e-13,
    /// establishing that the machinery around the law is right, and then checks the F99 table
    /// through the same machinery. Same device as PupilDiffraction reproducing AiryIntensity with
    /// its vanes removed.
    ///
    /// WHAT IS NOT MODELLED HERE, and is named rather than approximated:
    ///
    ///   * The 2175 Angstrom bump and the far-UV rise. Both laws have them; this file covers
    ///     0.3 to 3.4 inverse microns (294 nm to 3.3 microns), which contains every filter in
    ///     FilterCurves and leaves the bump, at 4.6 inverse microns, outside. A UV instrument
    ///     would need the Fitzpatrick and Massa (1990) parameterisation added, and the table
    ///     extended; the range check below refuses rather than extrapolating into it.
    ///   * Any variation of R_V along a single line of sight. One value per sight line is what
    ///     every published dust map supports.
    ///   * Scattering into the beam. Extinction is absorption plus scattering OUT of the line of
    ///     sight; a reflection nebula is the light scattered IN, which is a separate source term
    ///     and not an attenuation.
