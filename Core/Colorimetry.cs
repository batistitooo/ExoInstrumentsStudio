    /// function of temperature that can be fitted directly to RGB. It is the projection of the
    /// source's spectrum onto the three colour matching functions of a standard observer, which is a
    /// measurement of human vision (CIE 1931, still the basis of every colour standard), followed by
    /// a transform into whatever primaries the display has. Both steps are defined exactly. The
    /// piecewise power law this file replaces was a fit to somebody's plot of that chain, valid over
    /// a limited temperature range and applicable to nothing but blackbodies, which excludes every
    /// emission-line source in the mod, since a nebula's colour comes from three narrow lines and has
    /// no temperature at all.

    ///   (R,G,B)_display = transfer((R,G,B)_linear)               the sRGB transfer function

    /// Y is luminance by construction: ybar IS the CIE luminous efficiency function V(lambda).
    ///
    /// GAMUT. Astronomical colours routinely fall outside what a display can show; a pure emission
    /// line is a monochromatic stimulus, which lies ON the spectral locus and so outside every real
