    /// The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a REAL telescope pupil: an annular aperture crossed by
    /// straight secondary-support vanes. Rings and diffraction spikes come out of one calculation,
    /// because on a real telescope they come from one pupil.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS EXISTS. OpticalPsf and RadialPsfProfile handle the radially symmetric part exactly,
    /// but a spider is not radially symmetric, so no radial profile can carry it. The imaging
    /// display therefore drew its six spikes with an invented amplitude (4e-4 of peak at 1 lambda/D)
    /// on an invented azimuthal Gaussian (sigma = 1.3 degrees) and an invented 1/r^2 falloff. Three
    /// free parameters standing in for something the pupil determines outright.
    ///
    /// THE CALCULATION, and why it needs no free parameter. The far-field amplitude is the Fourier
    /// transform of the pupil's transmission. Transmission is a sum of simple shapes, and the
    /// transform is linear, so the amplitude is a sum of their transforms in closed form:
    ///
    ///   * A disc of radius a transforms to  pi*a^2 * 2*J1(2*pi*a*u) / (2*pi*a*u).
    ///     The annulus is the outer disc minus the obstruction disc.
    ///   * A rectangle transforms to a product of two sinc functions. Each vane is a rectangle of
    ///     width w spanning the open annulus radially, so it carries a phase from sitting off
    ///     centre; vanes on opposite sides of the pupil carry conjugate phases, and their sum is
    ///     real. That is why the six-vane sum below reduces to three cosine terms.
    ///
    ///       A_vane_pair = 2*w*L * sinc(pi*w*u_perp) * sinc(pi*L*u_par) * cos(2*pi*d*u_par)
    ///
    ///     with L the vane's radial length, d the radius of its midpoint, and u resolved along and
    ///     across the vane.
    ///
    /// Intensity is |A_total|^2, normalised by the on-axis value, which is just the pupil's open
    /// AREA: pi*R^2 - pi*R_in^2 - n*w*L. Every quantity above is a length measured on the real
    /// telescope. The spikes' amplitude, their angular width and their radial falloff are now all
    /// consequences of the vane geometry, and none of them can be tuned.
    ///
    /// The vanes are modelled as spanning only the OPEN annulus, from the obstruction's edge
    /// outward, so they neither overlap each other at the centre nor double-subtract the region the
    /// secondary already blocks. A real spider does converge on the secondary, which sits inside
    /// the obstruction and is therefore already dark.
    ///
    /// REDUCIBILITY. With vaneCount = 0 this must reproduce OpticalPsf.AiryIntensity exactly, since
    /// both are then the same annular pupil by two different routes (this one via the difference of
    /// two disc transforms, that one via the published obstructed-aperture form). The headless
    /// harness checks it.
