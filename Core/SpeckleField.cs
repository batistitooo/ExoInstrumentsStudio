    /// and this file carries their three numbers:
    ///
    ///   * A STATIC pattern holding 71.3% of the correlation (their rho_0 = 0.713 +/- 0.0005),
    ///     unchanged over the whole hour. Nothing in an exposure averages this down and no
    ///     calibration frame removes it. Only ADI or a reference star does.
    ///   * A FAST component of 5.9% (their Lambda = 0.059 +/- 0.002) decaying with tau = 3.5 +/- 0.2
    ///     seconds. Notably, they show this one is INSTRUMENTAL rather than atmospheric, since it
    ///     appears with the internal calibration lamp too.
    ///   * The remaining 22.8%, which has already decorrelated by their 0.63 s cadence. This is the
    ///     atmospheric residual, and its own timescale comes from Macintosh et al. (2005, SPIE
    ///     5903, 170): speckles from uncorrected atmospheric perturbation are refreshed as the wind
    ///     carries the turbulence across the pupil, on a timescale of 0.6 D/v.
    ///
    /// Over longer times the static part is not quite static either: they measure it decorrelating
    /// linearly at 73 ppm/s once the temporal median is subtracted, faster near the axis (a slope
    /// of about 49 ppm/s per arcsec) and settling to about 10 ppm/s beyond 500 mas. That rate is
    /// what sets how much of an ADI sequence's own reference is still valid at its end.
    ///
    /// WHERE THE SPECKLES ARE. Adaptive optics can only correct spatial frequencies its deformable
