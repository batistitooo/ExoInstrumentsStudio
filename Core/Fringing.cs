    /// Why a red image of a dark sky comes out corrugated.
    ///
    /// WHAT FRINGING IS. A thinned CCD is an etalon nobody meant to build. Light that reaches the
    /// silicon without being absorbed reflects off the far surface, comes back, and interferes with
    /// what is still arriving; the detector's response is therefore modulated by
    /// cos(2 pi P / lambda) with P = 2 n d the optical path across the layer. In the blue the
    /// silicon absorbs everything within a micron and there is nothing to reflect, so there are no
    /// fringes; past about 800 nm the absorption length approaches the layer thickness and the
    /// modulation becomes the dominant flat-field structure in the frame.
    ///
    /// WHY IT DOES NOT SIMPLY AVERAGE AWAY. Over a broad passband the phase 2 pi P / lambda runs
    /// through many turns, so a smooth source's fringes cancel almost exactly. The night sky is not
    /// a smooth source. Past 700 nm it is a picket fence of OH Meinel bands, and each line samples
    /// the modulation at one phase rather than averaging over it, so the fringes survive with the
    /// LINE SPECTRUM'S own weighting. That is why fringing is a property of the sky as much as of
    /// the detector, why it changes between exposures as the airglow does, and why flat-fielding on
    /// a continuum lamp does not remove it. This pipeline can compute that integral rather than
    /// assert it, because it already carries the airglow line spectrum at 0.1 nm sampling
    /// (Core.Airglow, Core.AirglowTable).
    ///
    /// WHAT IS MEASURED, AND BY WHOM. Two independent ESO measurements, from two papers, and the
    /// check that they agree is what this model rests on rather than on either alone:
    ///
    ///   * Walsh, Kuntschner, Jehin, Kaufer, O'Brien, Riquelme and Smette (2008, "Modelling the
    ///     Fringing of the FORS2 CCD", in "2007 ESO Instrument Calibration Workshop") fed a tunable
    ///     monochromator into FORS2's calibration unit and measured the peak-to-peak fringe
    ///     amplitude on the MIT mosaic at six wavelengths: nothing visible at 774 nm, then 2.2% at
    ///     876, 3.0% at 906, 5.1% at 926, 7.0% at 956 and 7.5% at 986 nm. They also give the fringe
    ///     WAVELENGTH PERIOD as 2.9 nm, measured from 300I flats taken in the ESO GOODS programme,
    ///     and the spatial scale as about 40 pixels between adjacent fringes at their closest.
    ///   * Downing, Baade, Sinclaire, Deiries and Christen (2006, SPIE Orlando) state the device:
    ///     "The MIT/LL CCID-20 is a 40 um thick high resistivity deep depletion CCD."
    ///
    /// THE TWO AGREE, and neither was derived from the other. A modulation of period Delta lambda
    /// at wavelength lambda implies an optical path P = lambda^2 / Delta lambda, so Walsh's 2.9 nm
    /// at 950 nm gives P = 311 um; dividing by twice the refractive index of silicon there (3.585,
    /// Green 2008) gives a layer 43.4 um thick, against the 40 um Downing et al. state outright.
    /// An 8.5% agreement between a spectroscopic period and a fabrication specification is a
    /// stronger foundation than either number on its own, and it is the reason the thickness below
    /// is the published one rather than the fitted one.
    ///
    /// WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THIS ROSTER, which is less than it first appears and is stated plainly.
    /// ESO's FORS2 manual is explicit that the MIT mosaic was chosen for low fringing: "For Bessel
    /// I imaging, fringes are hardly visible ... For z_Gunn imaging, the fringe amplitudes are below
    /// 1% and in the strongest telluric lines in spectroscopic modes fringe amplitudes were found
    /// to be of the order of 5% in the worst cases." Walsh's 7.5% is the MONOCHROMATIC amplitude at
    /// 986 nm, which is the spectroscopic regime; a broadband imaging filter integrates it down to
    /// the sub-percent figure the manual quotes. Both numbers are correct and they describe
    /// different measurements, and the integral below is what turns one into the other. On this
    /// roster the effect reaches FORS2's unfiltered "Luminance" band, which runs to 1100 nm, and
