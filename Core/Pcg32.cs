    /// Statistically Good Algorithms for Random Number Generation"), transcribed from the author's

    /// WHY THE PIPELINE NEEDED ITS OWN GENERATOR. Every stochastic step in this mod (shot noise,
    /// read noise, cosmic rays, the defect map, scintillation) ran on System.Random. That is a
    /// subtractive lagged-Fibonacci generator whose statistical weaknesses are well known, but the
    /// disqualifying problem is a different one: ITS OUTPUT IS NOT PART OF .NET'S CONTRACT. The
    /// sequence produced for a given seed is not guaranteed across runtime versions, and it in
    /// fact changed between .NET Framework and .NET Core. A simulation whose output cannot be
    /// reproduced from a recorded seed cannot be regression-tested at all, which blocks every
    /// check that would otherwise pin this pipeline's behaviour down.
    ///
    /// PCG fixes exactly that and nothing else is claimed for it: the algorithm is published, the
    /// reference implementation is fixed, the sequence for a seed is therefore stable forever and
    /// across platforms, and it passes TestU01's BigCrush battery, which System.Random does not.
    /// It is also smaller and faster: 64 bits of state, one multiply-add and one rotate per draw.
    ///
    /// DELIBERATELY A System.Random SUBCLASS. Every method the pipeline uses (Next, Next(int),
    /// NextDouble, NextBytes, and the protected Sample the base class routes through) is virtual,
    /// so overriding them makes this a drop-in replacement at every existing call site without
    /// changing a single signature, and without a second RNG interface for callers to get wrong.
    ///
    /// The stream ("sequence") parameter selects one of 2^63 distinct sequences from the same seed.
    /// That is what lets the capture pipeline draw its shot noise, its defect map and its cosmic
    /// rays from independent streams of one recorded seed, rather than interleaving them in one
    /// sequence where adding a draw in one place silently shifts every later draw everywhere.
