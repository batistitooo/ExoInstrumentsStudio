    /// The CCD equation: the signal-to-noise ratio of an aperture-photometry measurement, derived
    /// from the real electron budget of the observation.
    ///
    /// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Photometric precision used to be a one-parameter empirical scaling
    /// (InstrumentSpec.EstimatePrecision):
    ///
    ///     sigma(m) = sigma_ref * 10^(k * (m - m_ref))
    ///
    /// with k = 0.2 for every instrument in the roster. That relation is the pure photon-noise
    /// limit and nothing else: 10^(0.2 dm) is exactly 1/sqrt(flux ratio), so it asserts that every
    /// instrument is source-shot-noise-limited at every magnitude. Three consequences, all of
    /// which a real light curve shows and this one could not:
    ///
    ///   * There is no sky. A faint star's noise is dominated by the background it sits on, not by
    ///     its own photons, and that background is what makes moonlight, twilight and a poor site
    ///     matter. The single exponent cannot bend toward the sky-limited sigma ~ 10^(0.4 dm)
    ///     slope, so faint-end precision is optimistic by whatever the sky contributes.
    ///   * There is no read noise or dark current, so short exposures and long ones behave the
    ///     same way per unit time, and the read-noise-limited regime that ends every real
    ///     high-cadence run simply does not exist.
    ///   * Nothing depends on the aperture, the plate scale, the throughput or the detector, so
    ///     two instruments with the same sigma_ref are indistinguishable however different their
    ///     hardware is. The imaging half of this codebase already models all of that in real
    ///     electrons (SystemBandpass, SkyBrightnessModel, SolarSystemCameraTexture); the transit
    ///     half did not, and the two halves disagreed about what an instrument is.
    ///
    /// WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD. The CCD equation as published by Merline &amp; Howell (1995,
    /// Experimental Astronomy 6, 163, "A realistic model for point-sources imaged on array
    /// detectors: The model and initial results"), and reproduced as equation 4.9 of Howell
    /// (2006, "Handbook of CCD Astronomy", 2nd ed., CUP):
    ///
    ///     S/N = N_star / sqrt( N_star + n_pix * (1 + n_pix/n_B) * (N_S + N_D + N_R^2 + G^2 sigma_f^2) )
    ///
    ///   N_star  total electrons from the source inside the photometric aperture
    ///   n_pix   pixels in that aperture
    ///   n_B     pixels in the background region the sky level is estimated from
    ///   N_S     sky electrons per pixel over the exposure
    ///   N_D     dark electrons per pixel over the exposure
    ///   N_R     read noise, electrons per pixel per readout
    ///   G       gain, electrons per ADU; sigma_f the A/D converter's own quantisation error
    ///
    /// Each term is a variance in electrons, added because the processes are independent. The
    /// numerator is the signal; the (1 + n_pix/n_B) factor is Merline &amp; Howell's, and accounts
    /// for the fact that the sky level is not known but MEASURED, from a finite number of
    /// background pixels, so its own uncertainty propagates into every aperture pixel. It tends
    /// to 1 as the background region grows, which is the limit most textbook statements of the
    /// equation quote.
    ///
    /// The fractional uncertainty on the measured flux, which is what a light curve point's
    /// error bar is, is exactly the reciprocal, sigma_F/F = 1/(S/N).
    ///
    /// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT MODEL, deliberately, because each is either a separate published
    /// model or has no defensible value here:
    ///
    ///   * Scintillation. It is not a detector term and does not belong in this equation; it is
    ///     added in quadrature by the caller from Young (1967), already implemented in
    ///     AtmosphericNoise.
    ///   * Flat-field / PRNU residuals, which for a bright target on the ground are the dominant
    ///     systematic and are simply absent from this codebase (there is no flat-field model at
    ///     all). Precision on bright stars is therefore still optimistic, now for one identifiable
    ///     reason rather than for three.
    ///   * Detector non-linearity approaching full well, and any correlated ("red") noise.

    /// Pure C# with no Unity dependency and no instrument knowledge: everything is passed in, so
    /// this file can be exercised against the published equation on its own.
