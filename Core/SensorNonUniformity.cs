    /// The two ways one pixel differs from its neighbours no matter how long you look at it:
    /// it converts light at its own rate, and it reads out from its own zero.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS EXISTS, WHICH IS NOT "MORE NOISE". Every stochastic term already in this pipeline
    /// (shot, read, dark) is TEMPORAL: draw a second frame and you get a different realisation, so
    /// stacking averages it down and no calibration frame can remove it. The two terms here are the
    /// opposite kind. They are FIXED properties of this particular piece of silicon, identical in
    /// every exposure it ever takes, so stacking does NOT average them down and a calibration frame
    /// DOES remove them exactly. That distinction is the entire reason an observer takes flats and
    /// biases, and until now this pipeline had nothing for either of them to remove:
    ///
    ///   * A BIAS frame measured a pedestal that was one constant over the whole array, so
    ///     subtracting it was arithmetically the same as subtracting a number.
    ///   * A FLAT frame could not exist at all, because the array's photo response was uniform to
    ///     machine precision. Dividing by a flat would have divided by 1.
    ///
    /// PHOTO-RESPONSE NON-UNIFORMITY (PRNU) is the multiplicative one: pixel i collects
    /// (1 + p_i) times the array's mean signal from the same illumination, because its quantum
    /// efficiency, its fill factor and its microlens are all manufactured to a tolerance. It scales
    /// with the light, so it is invisible in a dark and dominant in a bright flat, and it is removed
    /// by DIVISION.
    ///
    /// OFFSET FIXED-PATTERN NOISE is the additive one: pixel i reads out from a zero displaced by
    /// o_i electrons, because its own source follower and its column amplifier have their own
    /// offsets. It does not scale with anything, it is present in a zero-second exposure, and it is
    /// removed by SUBTRACTION. This is the quantity ESO's own FORS2 bias QC1 recipe isolates and
    /// trends as QC.BIAS.FPN, measuring it from the difference of two raw biases shifted by 10x10
    /// pixels with the read-noise contribution removed, precisely because it is the component of a
    /// bias frame that a shift does not move.
    ///
    /// BOTH ARE DRAWN ONCE PER SENSOR, from a fixed serial-number seed, exactly as the hot/dead
    /// pixel map already is. That is not an optimisation, it is the physics: if these maps were
    /// redrawn per exposure they would be temporal noise wearing a fixed pattern's name, a flat
    /// taken on Tuesday would not correct a light taken on Wednesday, and the calibration this
    /// whole file exists to make possible would silently do nothing.
    ///
    /// WHAT IS NOT MODELLED HERE, and is listed in section 12 rather than approximated:
    ///
    ///   * TREE RINGS and BRICK WALLS. A real flat is not white noise. Thick back-illuminated CCDs
    ///     show concentric rings from radial dopant variations laid down as the silicon ingot grew,
    ///     and laser-annealed devices show a periodic imprint of the anneal; Luo et al. (2024,
    ///     AJ 168, 251, arXiv:2401.14944) measure both on one such device, the rings falling from
    ///     1.6% peak-to-valley at 287nm to 0.7% at 947nm and the brick walls from 18% to below 0.5%
    ///     over the same span. Neither pattern is published for any detector in this roster, and
    ///     borrowing another device's rings would put a specific, visible, wrong structure into
    ///     every frame. The white component below is therefore the whole of the modelled PRNU, and
    ///     is stated as a floor rather than a full description.
    ///   * WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE. The same paper shows PRNU is a function of wavelength, because
    ///     shorter-wavelength photons are absorbed nearer the back surface. The published EMVA
    ///     figure used here is a single broadband number, so the model carries no colour term.
