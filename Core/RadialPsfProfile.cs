    /// The exact annular-pupil diffraction pattern, tabulated as a radial profile so it can be
    /// SAMPLED at arbitrary radii rather than convolved as a kernel.
    ///
    /// Why this exists alongside OpticalPsf.BuildKernel. Two different jobs need the same physics
    /// in two different shapes:
    ///
    ///   * A rendered frame that already contains sources (the solar-system camera) needs the PSF
    ///     as a KERNEL, to convolve into an existing image. That is OpticalPsf.BuildKernel.
    ///   * A frame SYNTHESISED point by point around a known source position (the high-contrast
    ///     imaging display) needs the PSF as a FUNCTION of angular offset, evaluated per pixel.
    ///     That is this class.
    ///
    /// Both draw the intensity from the same closed form, OpticalPsf.AiryIntensity, so there is
    /// exactly one diffraction model in the project. Before this class existed the imaging display
    /// carried its own Gaussian core plus an invented ring envelope, which was a second, mutually
    /// inconsistent answer to a question Core already answered exactly.
    ///
    /// PIXEL AVERAGING, and why it is required rather than cosmetic. The Airy pattern oscillates
    /// with a radial period of about lambda/D. A detector pixel does not read the intensity at a
    /// point; it integrates it over its own area. When the plate scale is fine compared with
    /// lambda/D the two agree, but the high-contrast display's field of view is set by the target's
    /// planet separation, and at wide separations a single display pixel spans SEVERAL rings. Point
    /// sampling there does not merely look wrong: it aliases, landing at random on ring maxima and
    /// nulls, so the same physical pattern would render as arbitrary structure that changes with
    /// the field of view. Averaging is what the detector does, and it is also what makes the
    /// display's appearance a function of the optics rather than of the raster.
    ///
    /// HOW THE AVERAGE IS TAKEN. A radial profile holds one value per radius, so what it must hold
    /// is the mean over the RING of pixels at that radius. Those pixels sit at every orientation
    /// relative to the detector grid, so the quantity wanted is the average of the intensity over a
    /// square pixel, itself averaged over the pixel's orientation about the source. Two regimes:
    ///
    ///   * Within a few pixels of the source, that two-dimensional average is evaluated directly.
    ///     Here the intensity varies strongly across the pixel in BOTH directions and no
    ///     one-dimensional reduction is faithful: taking only the radial extent overstates the peak
    ///     by up to 11% of it, because the disc of radius p/2 it averages over is 21% smaller than
    ///     the pixel that is really there.
    ///   * Beyond six pixels, the pixel subtends a narrow angle at the source, the intensity is
    ///     effectively constant along its azimuthal extent, and the average collapses to a
    ///     one-dimensional integral over the pixel's radial extent weighted by r dr. This is the
    ///     narrow-angle limit of the same integral rather than a different model, and the harness
    ///     measures both the step at the crossover and the residual against a brute-force
    ///     two-dimensional average written independently of this file.
    ///
    /// The split matters computationally: the two-dimensional form costs O(n^2) evaluations per
    /// table entry against O(n) for the radial one, and a table spans several hundred pixels while
    /// the region needing two dimensions spans six.
    ///
    /// Measured residual against that independent brute force, over plate scales from 0.1 to 4
    /// lambda/D per pixel: at worst 8e-4 of the peak intensity. On the imaging display's nine-decade
    /// logarithmic stretch that is under a twentieth of one of its 256 levels.
