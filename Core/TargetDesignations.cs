    /// WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL. Every catalogue writes its own designations its own way, and the
    /// mod installs several. HyperLEDA writes the Andromeda Galaxy NGC0224, zero-padded and
    /// unspaced. SIMBAD writes it NGC 224 with the number right-aligned in a fixed field, so its
    /// raw form is "NGC   224". The nebula list here writes NGC 1976 with one space. A player types
    /// ngc224, or ngc 224, or M31. A substring search over the raw strings gets none of those right
    /// and several of them wrong: "NGC 24" is a substring of "NGC 247".
    ///
    /// WHAT A KEY IS. Lowercase, whitespace and punctuation removed between the catalogue prefix
    /// and its number, leading zeros dropped, so all of the above collapse onto "ngc224". Star
    /// designations go through StarNames.Normalize first, which is the same idea applied to Greek
    /// letters and constellation genitives: "beta Pictoris", "bet Pic" and "Beta Pic" all become
    /// "bet pic".
    ///
    /// EXACT, NOT FUZZY. There is no edit distance and no phonetic matching anywhere here. A key
    /// either matches or it does not, and everything else is left to plain substring search on a
    /// separate loose form. Fuzzy matching in a catalogue of tens of thousands of numbered objects
