    ///    |FT(pupil)|^2 in closed form (Born &amp; Wolf, "Principles of Optics", the obstructed-
    ///    aperture case): with x = pi*D*theta/lambda and obstruction ratio eps,

    ///
    ///    Real Airy rings, and the real effect of the obstruction on them (a larger secondary
    ///    pushes energy out of the core and into the first ring). No profile is assumed.
    ///
    /// 2. ATMOSPHERE: the exact long-exposure Kolmogorov term, not a fitted Gaussian or
    ///    Moffat profile. Fried (1966) gives the long-exposure atmospheric transfer function
    ///
    ///        T_atm(f) = exp[ -3.44 * (lambda*f/r0)^(5/3) ]
    ///
    ///    for angular frequency f (cycles/radian), which is Kolmogorov turbulence's own
    ///    5/3-power structure function and nothing more. Because that has no closed-form
    ///    real-space counterpart, the PSF is recovered by numerically Hankel-transforming it
    ///    (a radially symmetric 2D Fourier transform is a zeroth-order Hankel transform), which
    ///    is exact up to quadrature error rather than a shape approximation.

    /// nominal width implied, and did so unphysically. Every profile here has a monotonically
    /// decreasing transfer function with no zeros inside the passband.
