    /// High-resolution patches of one emission line, over the sky where a finer survey exists.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS. The all-sky H-alpha composite has a 6 arcmin beam, and every structure
    /// that makes a nebula recognisable is finer than that: the Horsehead spans 1.3 beams, M42's
    /// Trapezium 0.8, the filaments in IC 1396A 0.3. No processing recovers them, because the
    /// information is not in the file. A finer survey does exist over part of the sky; SHASSA
    /// (Gaustad et al. 2001, PASP 113, 1326) images everything south of +15 degrees at 0.8 arcmin,
    /// and at that beam the Horsehead spans 10 elements instead of 1.3.
    ///
    /// WHY PATCHES AND NOT A FINER ALL-SKY MAP. Resolution is only worth storing where there is
    /// something to resolve. The whole sky at 0.86 arcmin is 201 million cells, 403 MB, of which the
    /// overwhelming majority carries diffuse background that 6 arcmin already describes perfectly
    /// well. Four degrees around each catalogued object is 78 thousand cells apiece, about 5 MB for
    /// the entire catalogue, eighty times smaller for the same result on every target anyone
    /// points at. Outside a patch the base map answers, which is the same layered arrangement every
    /// real survey archive uses.
    ///
    /// STORAGE is run-length by HEALPix ring. In RING ordering a disc on the sky cuts each ring in
    /// one contiguous stretch of pixels, so a patch is a few hundred runs rather than a pixel index
    /// per value, which would otherwise cost three times as much as the values themselves.
    ///
    /// The patch carries TOTAL surface brightness, not a correction: the packer folds the composite
    /// in and apodises the fine structure to zero across the patch's outer margin, so a patch joins
    /// the base map continuously and reproduces it exactly when smoothed back to 6 arcmin. What
    /// SHASSA supplies is the structure; the absolute calibration stays the composite's. See
