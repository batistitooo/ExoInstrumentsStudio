    /// The empirical scaling this replaces needs two numbers per instrument and can be written
    /// down from a survey's headline precision figure. The CCD equation needs eleven, and each one
    /// is a measured property of a specific piece of hardware. A missing entry cannot be filled in
    /// with something plausible: an invented throughput or read noise does not degrade the result
    /// gracefully, it produces a precision that looks physical, carries units, and is wrong by an
    /// unknown factor, which is strictly worse than the honest empirical relation, because it
    /// cannot be recognised as an estimate.
    ///
    /// So a field left null means UNSOURCED, not zero. IsComplete is false while any required
    /// field is unsourced, TransitPhotometry then declines to run, and LightCurveSimulator falls
    /// back to InstrumentSpec.EstimatePrecision unchanged. MissingFields() names exactly what is

    /// discovering which one was wrong.
