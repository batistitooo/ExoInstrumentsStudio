    /// The zscale algorithm (Tody 1986, "The IRAF Data Reduction and Analysis System", SPIE 627,

    ///
    /// WHY A TRANSFER CURVE IS NOT ENOUGH. A log or asinh curve decides how the range between black
    /// and white is distributed. It does not decide where black and white ARE, and on an
    /// astronomical frame that is the larger question by far: an exposure of a faint nebula spans
    /// perhaps twenty counts of a sixteen-thousand-count converter, sitting on a pedestal of sky
    /// and bias. Mapping the converter's full range to the display puts the entire subject inside
    /// the bottom few percent of it, and no curve applied afterwards can recover contrast that was
    /// never allocated. That is the difference between a grey fog and a nebula, and it is why every
    /// real display tool (DS9, IRAF, Siril, PixInsight) sets its limits from the data.
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS, and why it is not just a percentile clip. The samples are SORTED and a line is
    /// fitted to them against their rank, with iterative rejection. On an astronomical frame most
    /// pixels are sky, so the middle of that sorted array is a long shallow stretch whose slope
    /// measures the noise; the sources are the steep tail at the top, and the rejection throws them
    /// out of the fit. Extrapolating the sky's own slope across the full pixel count, divided by a
    /// contrast factor, gives limits set by the noise the frame actually has rather than by its
    /// extremes; so one saturated star cannot flatten the whole image, which is exactly what a
    /// max-based or high-percentile clip does.
