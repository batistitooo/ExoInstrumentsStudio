    ///
    ///     N_e = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m) * FWHM * QE_peak * T_extinction(lambda_c) * area * time
    ///
    /// Every factor after the magnitude is evaluated at one wavelength, or is a single headline
    /// number standing in for a curve. That is the standard back-of-envelope exposure-time
    /// calculation, and it is wrong in three ways that matter here, all in the same direction:
    ///
    ///   * QE_peak is by definition the detector's best wavelength. FORS2's own published curve
    ///     runs 58% at 400nm against 86% at its 600nm peak, so a b_HIGH exposure was credited
    ///     with about 1.5x the electrons it really collects.
    ///   * Extinction at lambda_c alone. The Luminance position is 7700 Angstrom wide on FORS2
    ///     and the extinction coefficient varies by a factor of three across it (k_B 0.38 vs
    ///     k_R 0.13, see AtmosphericImagingNoise), so one sample cannot represent the band.
    ///   * No optical throughput at all. Every photon entering the aperture was collected: no
    ///     mirror reflectivity, no filter peak transmission, no relay optics. A real 0.51m
    ///     instrument does not reach the limiting magnitude that implies.
    ///
    /// WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD. The same integral a real synthetic-photometry package performs
    /// (synphot, GalSim's Bandpass, SkyMaker): the source's photon spectrum is multiplied by the
    /// full system response and integrated over wavelength.
    ///
    ///     N_e = area * time * integral[ n_lambda(lambda) * S(lambda) ] d lambda
    ///     S(lambda) = T_filter * T_optics * QE(lambda) * T_atmosphere(lambda, X) * T_nd
    ///
    /// The source's absolute scale still comes from its measured magnitude, by normalising its
    /// spectral SHAPE at the Johnson V effective wavelength where that magnitude is defined:
    /// n_lambda(lambda_V) = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m). Factoring that out leaves a single number that
    /// carries the whole integral:
    ///
    ///     W = integral[ (phi(lambda)/phi(lambda_V)) * S(lambda) ] d lambda      [Angstrom]
    ///     N_e = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m) * W * area * time
    ///
    /// which has exactly the shape of the old formula with (FWHM * QE * T) replaced by W. So W
    /// is the system's real EFFECTIVE PHOTOMETRIC WIDTH for this particular source: what the
    /// passband is worth once the detector, the optics, the air and the source's own colour are
    /// all accounted for.
    ///
    /// The construction is deliberately reducible: for a flat source spectrum, a grey QE and a
    /// grey atmosphere, the integral collapses to W = FWHM * QE * T and reproduces the previous
    /// model exactly. That is asserted in the headless harness, so the new path is provably a
    /// generalisation of the old one rather than a different model that happens to look similar.
