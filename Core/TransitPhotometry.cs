    /// do NOT share is the noise realisation: the camera draws real Poisson deviates per pixel,
    /// while this collapses the same budget analytically into one sigma per exposure, which is the

    ///      this airmass, from SystemResponse: the filter, the optics, the QE curve, the
    ///      atmosphere and the star's colour, integrated over the passband.
    ///   2. Total source electrons over the exposure, from the star's apparent magnitude
    ///      (PhotonFluxModel), through the real obstructed collecting area.
    ///   3. The photometric aperture: radius 0.68 FWHM (Howell 1989), its area in pixels, and the
    ///      fraction of the source's flux inside it.
    ///   4. Sky electrons per pixel, summed as real V surface brightnesses over airglow, zodiacal
    ///      light and moonlight, each attenuated the way its own origin requires.
    ///   5. Dark and read noise from the detector's own figures.
    ///   6. CcdEquation -> sigma_F/F.
    ///   7. Scintillation (Young 1967) added in quadrature, because it is an atmospheric transfer
    ///      effect and not a term of the CCD equation.
