# dust-crossvalidation

The extinction **law** — the first layer of the dust pipeline, and the one everything else multiplies
by. Cross-validated against `dust_extinction` 1.5, the astropy-affiliated reference implementation.

An extinction curve splits into an **amount** and a **shape**:

```
A(lambda) = A(V) k(lambda),    A(V) = R_V E(B-V),    k(lambda) = A(lambda)/A(V)
```

The amount, `E(B-V)`, is a property of the sight line and comes from a dust map. The shape is a
property of the grains, parameterised by `R_V = A(V)/E(B-V)`. This directory establishes the shape.

## Two laws, deliberately

| | |
|---|---|
| **CCM89** — Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989), *ApJ* **345**, 245 | closed-form polynomials in `x = 1/lambda`. Exactly implementable, nothing to interpolate. Kept as the **control**. |
| **F99** — Fitzpatrick (1999), *PASP* **111**, 63 | better in the optical, where every instrument in the roster works. Not closed-form: a cubic spline through published anchor points, so it is carried as a generated table. **The default.** |

Reimplementing F99's spline construction and matching its knot placement would be a way to introduce
an error that looks like physics. Sampling the reference implementation on a grid finer than any
structure the curve contains is not an approximation of the law; it is the law, sampled. Same
treatment, and the same reason, as `FilterCurves` carrying ESO's measured transmissions rather than
assuming top-hats. `generate_f99_table.py` produces `Core/Fitzpatrick99Table.cs`; the harness then
checks that table against the same reference, so a drift between them is caught rather than assumed
away.

## Results

**CCM89 is exact.** Against the reference over 1199 wavenumbers × 6 values of `R_V`:

| R_V | 2.0 | 2.6 | 3.1 | 3.85 | 4.4 | 5.5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| max abs deviation | 2.2e-15 | 1.8e-15 | 1.6e-15 | 1.1e-15 | 1.1e-15 | 8.9e-16 |

Getting there found one real thing: CCM89's optical polynomials are published for `1.1 <= x < 3.3`,
and `x = 3.3` is where the paper hands over **to** the ultraviolet branch, not the last point of the
optical one. An inclusive bound there is a single point of disagreement with every other
implementation, worth 1.8e-4, and machine precision everywhere else.

**The F99 table costs 2.6e-5** in `A(lambda)/A(V)`, i.e. **8.1e-5 mag** at `E(B-V) = 1`, measured at
wavenumbers four times finer than the grid and at `R_V` values deliberately placed *between* rows.

Getting there found a second thing. Interpolating in `R_V` cost 8.6e-3 at `R_V = 3.85`; interpolating
in **1/R_V** costs 2.6e-5 on the same grid, two and a half orders of magnitude better. That is not a
tuning choice: every published law is written `a(x) + b(x)/R_V`, so at fixed wavelength the curve is
a straight line in `1/R_V` and a curve in `R_V`. Interpolating in the wrong variable is what left
the error.

**The reddening behaves.** At `E(B-V) = 1`, `R_V = 3.1`, F99:

| band | 440 nm (B) | 551 nm (V) | 658 nm (R) | 806 nm (I) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A(lambda) | 4.059 | 3.024 | 2.348 | 1.693 mag |
| A/A(V) | 1.3423 | 1 | 0.7765 | 0.5598 |

`A(lambda)` scales with `E(B-V)` to machine precision, which is what makes the map's amount and the
law's shape separable at all, and the curve never rises toward the red.

**The two laws are two laws.** Over 333–909 nm at `R_V = 3.1` they differ by up to 0.062 in
`A(lambda)/A(V)`, which is **0.19 mag at `E(B-V) = 1`** — the literature-sized residual between
CCM89's optical polynomial and F99's spline, and the reason F99 is the default. A harness where they
agreed exactly would be one where only one of them was being evaluated.

## The one subtlety worth knowing

**F99 does not return exactly 1 at V.** The reference implementation gives `k(V) = 0.9793` at
`x = 1.82` for `R_V = 3.1`. That is the published law, not a defect in the table: F99's optical
spline knots sit at 6000, 5470, 4670 and 4110 Å, and V is not one of them.

It is not a problem either, because `A(V) = R_V E(B-V)` is a relation between **band-integrated**
extinctions. `A(V)` is what a source loses through the Johnson V passband — an integral of the
reddened spectrum against the filter — not the value of the curve at one wavelength. Monochromatic
`k(V) = 1` is a property of how a law chooses to anchor itself; CCM89 anchors at a wavelength and
satisfies it by construction, F99 anchors through a spline and does not.

The band-integrated closure is the meaningful one and it is **not testable here**, because it needs
the Johnson B and V passbands integrated against a source spectrum. That is exactly what
`SystemResponse` is for, and it is where this check belongs once the reddening is wired into the
bandpass — the same argument this codebase already made for atmospheric extinction, which had to
move inside the integral for the same reason.

## What this does NOT establish

- **The shape only.** No dust map, no `E(B-V)` for any sight line, nothing about how much dust is
  actually in front of anything.
- **Optical and near-infrared only**, 294 nm to 3.33 µm. The 2175 Å bump sits at `x = 4.6`, outside;
  `RelativeExtinction` returns 0 rather than extrapolating into it, and a UV instrument would need
  the Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990) parameterisation added.
- **One R_V per sight line.** Which is all any published all-sky map supports; Schlafly et al. (2016)
  map R_V variation, and the table's second axis exists for the day that lands.
- **Extinction, not scattering into the beam.** A reflection nebula is a source term, not an
  attenuation.

## Running

```
